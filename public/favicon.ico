# Favicon Placeholder

This file should be replaced with an actual favicon.ico file.

For now, you can:
1. Create a simple favicon using online tools
2. Use the Ridgeline Audio logo converted to ICO format
3. Ensure it's 16x16, 32x32, and 48x48 pixels for different uses

Recommended favicon should include:
- Simple "R" or "RA" monogram
- Mountain-inspired design
- Clean, recognizable at small sizes
